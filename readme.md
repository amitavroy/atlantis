# Atlantis

This is an application which I will use for many of my day to day activity. It has many modules which are listed below:

1. Added the [Vali theme](https://pratikborsadiya.in/vali-admin/) to the project.
2. Tasks - This is a way for me to keep a track of things that I need to do and things which are pending.
3. Site Monitoring - A module which I use to monitor the uptime of my sites. A simple code which runs every minute and call the site urls and records the time. If the previous time is more than 30% of the average then an email is sent to the mentioned email address.
